# Biography

**Hi!** I'm **Camilo Valenzuela**. Although I studied Informatics Engenieering, I beleive my strong area is in Statistics and Machine Learning.

Most of my work has been done in Astroinformatics, but im not afraid to go out of my confort zone to deal with a challenging problem.

Always looking for new fun stuff to do I've learned a little bit of everything, for example, continous integration tools, big data frameworks, testing and visualization.

I'm a geek when it comes to hobbies, in my free time I like to research and play with  specialized coffee, photography and baking; Also gaming takes a good part of my free time.
