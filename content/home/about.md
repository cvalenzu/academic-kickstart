# Biography

**Hi!** I'm **Camilo Valenzuela**. Although I studied Informatics Engineering, I believe my strong area is Statistics and Machine Learning.

Most of my work has been done in Astroinformatics, but im not afraid to go out of my confort zone to deal with a challenging problem, now I'm working on Wind Power Forecasting and Time Series Models.

I've learned a little bit of everything, from continous integration tools and testing, to big data frameworks and visualization.

I'm a geek when it comes to hobbies, in my free time I like to research and play with  speciality coffee, photography and baking; Also gaming takes a good part of my free time.
